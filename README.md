# Instacart Sales Analysis and Customer Segmentation
I worked with multiple datasets for Instacart using Python. I subsequently wrote a report outlining my analysis methodology, findings, and suggestions in response to important Instacart business queries.

## Objective
As an analyst for Instacart, an online grocery store operating through a mobile app, the primary objective was to conduct an initial data and exploratory analysis to derive insights and propose strategies for better customer segmentation. This analysis aimed to uncover sales patterns and identify different customer profiles based on provided criteria.

## Context
Instacart stakeholders are keen on understanding the diverse range of customers in their database and their purchasing behaviors. They recognize the need for targeted marketing strategies tailored to specific customer profiles to maximize product sales. The key questions guiding this analysis include:

1. What is the distribution of users based on brand loyalty?
2. Do ordering habits vary among customers based on loyalty status or region?
3. Is there a correlation between age, family status, and ordering habits?
4. What demographic classifications emerge from the data?
5. What differences exist in ordering habits across different customer profiles?

## Data & Tools
The analysis utilized multiple open-source datasets from Instacart, including a custom customer dataset (created and included for the purpose of this project by Career Foundry). The data were analyzed using Python programming language along with libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, and scipy.

## Methodology
The analysis followed a structured approach encompassing data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and recommendation stages. Python scripts were used for data cleaning, manipulation, and statistical analysis. Key steps included:

* **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, standardizing data formats, and ensuring data consistency.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Investigating relationships between variables, identifying trends, and conducting statistical analyses.
* **Visualization**: Creating visual representations of the data using matplotlib and seaborn to facilitate insights.
* **Customer Segmentation**: Employing clustering algorithms to identify distinct customer groups based on purchasing behavior.
* **Recommendations**: Drawing actionable insights from the analysis to inform marketing strategies and product recommendations.

## Report
The findings and recommendations of the analysis are summarized in an Excel report, which includes detailed descriptions of data cleaning processes, population flow, data wrangling techniques, visualizations, and strategic recommendations.
